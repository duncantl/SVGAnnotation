Title: Tools for post-processing SVG plots created in R
Description: This package is an example of how we can post-process
  SVG files generated with R graphics, at present just those generated
  via the svg() function within R itself using the cairo library.
  (Support for RSVGDevice may be added in the future.)
  The idea is that we can add "effects" to the SVG components such as
  putting tooltips on the elements (points, bars, etc.) in the plot,
  animating points over "time" within one or more plots, changing colors
  of symbols within plots for simple linking.
  The package provides high-level facilities for annotating the plots, and also
  low-level facilities for finding plot regions, lattice panels and strips, 
  determining coordinates of regions and so on. Others can use these to provide
  additional annotation functionality.
  This also provides facilities for adding a reference to a CSS file so that 
  the appearance of certain types of elements can be controlled externally,
  e.g. links.
  This package contains JavaScript code for inteactive GUI components 
  rendered via SVG. This is code written by Andreas Neumann and Andreas Winter
  and obtained from http://www.carto.net/papers/svg/gui.
  This differs from Tony Plate's RSVGTipsDevice as a) it uses
  the SVG device within R based on libcairo, and b) it does not use global
  variables and require tooltips and hyperrefs to be specified one at a time
  and before drawing each individual shape.  Instead, this approach allows us deal
  with all elements of an R plot and add SVG features to each of them.
  This package was put together as a proof of concept and example of how to go about doing
  this sort of post-processing to enhance R plots to make them interactive and dynamic/animated.
  More can be done and what has been done can be done better. Others are encouraged to 
  submit enhancements, changes, etc.
